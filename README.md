# Possible AI Adaption:
One way to accelerate this project would be to use AI, this originally would have been something that was impossible to have a list of every addicting site, however, if you find a way to utilize existing-developed AI tools to detect whether a site is distracting or not you could accelerate this project significantly, this would make the list adaptable, which is crucial for detecting whether a site is distracting or not. Another factor to take into account would be how the user is using the website, this could be provided to the AI by telling it what your use-case is and having an adaptable list based on that, blocking websites that are not relevant to the task.
