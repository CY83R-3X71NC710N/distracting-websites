# Possible AI Adaption:
One way to accelerate this project would be to use AI. This originally would have been something that was impossible to have a list of every addicting site. However, if you find a way to utilize existing-developed AI tools to detect whether a site is distracting or not, you could accelerate this project significantly. This would make the list adaptable, which is crucial for detecting whether a site is distracting or not. Another factor to take into account would be how the user is using the website. This could be provided to the AI by telling it what your use-case is and having an adaptable list based on that, blocking websites that are not relevant to the task.

# Initial Hurdle:
Real-time content analysis and categorization is required.

# What exists now:

* Website Categorization APIs: Several APIs (like Google Cloud's Natural Language API, Amazon Comprehend, or specialized website categorization services) can analyze website content and attempt to categorize it (e.g., news, social media, shopping). These are a good starting point but aren't perfect at detecting "distraction" as it's subjective.
* Browser Extensions with Blocking Features: Many browser extensions (like StayFocusd, LeechBlock, or similar) allow you to block websites based on lists or schedules. These are powerful but rely on manually curated lists.
* Focus Apps: Apps like Freedom or Cold Turkey can block distracting apps and websites across devices, often with scheduling features. Again, they usually rely on pre-defined lists.

# Privacy/Security Issues:
Manual lists can be used and input by the user for sites the AI should not analyze. These include banking sites, etc. Or... Another solution would be completely running the AI locally. This would slow down the computer and likely have safety issues if local files are deleted using urandom overwrite. Obviously, it would be much faster to find a middle ground and just not scan sites that contain sensitive data. However, as computers evolve, this task becomes more trivial and more security-focused.

# Ambitious. Is it achievable?

Yes, this project is fully achievable considering the technology that is available today. It just has to be done. I currently lack the time to put this into practicality. However, soon I will have the time, and then I will develop this project.

# The Issue:
Currently, websites are not the only distracting element of computers; there are also apps. AI-detection of apps is where the practicality of the project goes down, so I am actively brainstorming solutions to this dilemma.

# My Take On Existing Tools:
They are not effective considering the adaptable nature of websites. However, with the rise of AI, this can be resolved.

# What could a tool like this do?:

A tool like this that combines both browser blocking functionality (websites) and app blocking functionality (TBD) would be game-changing for productivity both in schools, the workplace, and overall more healthy use of computers in an information-overloaded society. Having the AI determine what is useful for the given task and blocking what is not is not just a tool at this point. It is freedom to have computers be your asset, not your liability. This would revolutionize computers once again, allowing distractions to be eliminated. When tools are properly utilized, I would expect workplace productivity to skyrocket to rates that have not been seen before. Higher workflow economy means higher GDP, which means a healthier life according to the HDI index.

# Power of Audio in Computers.

Your eyes control your focus; this has been backed by neuroscientific studies. However, audio remains the key issue when it comes to distractions. Audio is the most distracting of the five senses, which is why when using a computer, it is effective to use a tool like brain.fm or endel to create a personalized focus environment. So by blocking websites and apps, the eyes are controlled. By using the audio, the ears are controlled. By using the keyboard, the tactile senses are controlled. This would create the most productive computer in the world. The next task would be using AI to assist with what to spend time on, not how you spend the time.
