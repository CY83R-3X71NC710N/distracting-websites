# Possible AI Adaption:
One way to accelerate this project would be to use AI, this originally would have been something that was impossible to have a list of every addicting site, however, if you find a way to utilize existing-developed AI tools to detect whether a site is distracting or not you could accelerate this project significantly, this would make the list adaptable, which is crucial for detecting whether a site is distracting or not. Another factor to take into account would be how the user is using the website, this could be provided to the AI by telling it what your use-case is and having an adaptable list based on that, blocking websites that are not relevant to the task.

# Inital Hurdle:

Real-time content analysis is required.

# What exists now:

* Website Categorization APIs: Several APIs (like Google Cloud's Natural Language API, Amazon Comprehend, or specialized website categorization services) can analyze website content and attempt to categorize it (e.g., news, social media, shopping). These are a good starting point but aren't perfect at detecting "distraction" as it's subjective.
* Browser Extensions with Blocking Features: Many browser extensions (like StayFocusd, LeechBlock, or similar) allow you to block websites based on lists or schedules. These are powerful but rely on manually curated lists.
* Focus Apps: Apps like Freedom or Cold Turkey can block distracting apps and websites across devices, often with scheduling features. Again, they usually rely on pre-defined lists.

# Privacy/Security Issues:
Manual lists can be used and inputed by the user for sites the AI should not analyze, these include banking sites, etc.

# Ambitious Is it achieveable?

Yes this project is fully achieveable considering the technology that is available today, it just has to be done. I currently lack the time to put this into practicality however, soon I will have the time, and then I will develop this project.

# The Issue:
Currently, websites are not the only distracting element of computers, there is also apps, AI-detection of apps is where the practicality of the project goes down, so I am actively brainstroming solutions to this dillemia.
